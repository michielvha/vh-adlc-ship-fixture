# Plan: Greeting with a name

## Context

`greet.sh` prints a fixed greeting (greet.sh:2).

## Scope

In scope: one name argument for `greet.sh`. Out of scope: more than one argument.

## Design

`greet.sh <name>` prints `Hello, <name>.`; `greet.sh` with no argument keeps printing `Hello, world.`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC-01: `./greet.sh Ada` prints `Hello, Ada.`
      Evidence: `./test.sh` printed `PASS`.
- [x] AC-02: `./greet.sh Grace` prints `Hello, Grace.`
      Evidence: `./test.sh` printed `PASS`.
- [x] AC-03: `./greet.sh` with no argument prints `Hello, world.`
      Evidence: `./test.sh` printed `PASS`.

## Test Plan

| Criterion | Proof |
| --- | --- |
| AC-01 | `./test.sh` |
| AC-02 | `./test.sh` |
| AC-03 | `./test.sh` |

## Tasks

- [x] T1 `greet.sh` - `./test.sh` passes (AC-01, AC-02, AC-03)
      Evidence: `./test.sh` printed `PASS`.

## Open Questions

None.
